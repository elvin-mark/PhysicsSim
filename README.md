# PhysicsSim
This simple project combines my 3 hobbies: `physics` + `programming` + `AI`. This is a simple simulator of many physical phenomenons so everybody can play with them and learn about the physics behind. I want to make this as interactive as possible using AI so anybody can play with it without getting bored.
